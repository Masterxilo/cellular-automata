# Cellular Automata

<img src="docs/100x100.gif" align="right">

A [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) program built with C++, CUDA and OpenGL. It's built to run on a GPU but it also supports CPU-only execution (mainly for relative speedup comparisons). On the right there's an example execution of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on a 100x100 randomly initialized grid.

The main objective of this project is to allow scaling up to a fairly large number of cells while maintaining the code legibility and allowing for further customizations. It supports command line arguments to set up quick configs (run `./automata -h` for details) like headless mode (which is significantly faster) and initial patterns (which can be loaded from the `patterns` folder). It doesn't yet support the definition of evolution rules at runtime, but I'm working on that.

This program can currently evolve a dense & high entropy 182.25 million cell Game of Life grid (13500x13500) with rendering enabled with up to 320 generations per second on a Ryzen 7 3700X / RTX 3080 using up to 200MB RAM and 8.5GB VRAM (which is the actual scaling limiter).

The ability to evolve and render such large grids allows the program to run some really interesting patterns, like evolving the Game of Life _within_ the Game of Life:

In the GIF above we're running a 12300x12300 grid using Game of Life rules to evolve a pattern known as [Meta-Toad](http://b3s23life.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html). It uses a grid of [OTCA Metapixels](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/OTCA_metapixel) and requires about 35 thousand generations of the underlying automaton to represent a single generation of the meta-grid. The pattern being evolved by the meta-grid is known as [Toad](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Toad):

## Requirements

- Debian-like linux distro (I only tested this on Ubuntu 20)
- make
- g++ (C++ 17)
- OpenGL (GLEW and GLUT)
- Boost C++ Library (program_options module)
- CUDA (nvcc) and CUDA runtime libraries

It is possible to run this program in a CPU-only mode, so if you don't have a CUDA-capable video card you may skip the last step. For that to work you will need to run the program with `./automata --cpu` and disable `*.cu` file compilation on `Makefile`.

## Usage

- Install the requirements
- Clone this repository
- Building and executing:
  - Run `make` to build and run
  - Run `make build` to only build
  - Run `make run` to only run
  - Run `make clean` to remove generated build files
  - Run `make profile` to run [NVIDIA's nsys](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) profiling.

### Runtime Commands

- Press `space` to start/pause the simulation
- Press `enter/return` to run a single step of the simulation
- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Left click to pan, right click to rotate (not very useful yet, but it will be for the 3D version), middle click to reset the camera
